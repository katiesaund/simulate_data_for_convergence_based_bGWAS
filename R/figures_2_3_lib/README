The three files in this directory will generate figures 2 and 3 in the hogwash methods paper. 
These files are meant to be run from this directory directly. 
To generate the figures: 
$ cd ~/simulate_data_for_convergence_based_bGWAS/R/figures_2_3_lib/
$ Rscript generate_figure_2.R
$ Rscript generate_figure_3.R

Files will be saved in ~/simulate_data_for_convergence_based_bGWAS/img/ as
Figure_2_hogwash_test_schema.pdf and
Figure_3_grouping_examples.pdf

To finalize the plots for the paper I added titles within Adobe Illustrator.
