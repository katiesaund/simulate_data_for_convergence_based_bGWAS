# simulate_data_for_convergence_based_bGWAS
Simulation of genotype and phenotype data to benchmark convergence based bacterial genome-wide association study (bGWAS) methods

# Repo contents
This repository contains the R code necessary to simulate data that controls for the amount of genotype convergence, phenotype convergence, and their intersection on a phylogenetic tree. 

This code is under active development as of February 2020. Please check back for a finalized version of this code.

The simulated data are being created to specifically benchmark the performance of [hogwash](https://github.com/katiesaund/hogwash). The results of the benchmarking will be reported in a methods paper (check back later for a manuscript posted to bioRxiv).
